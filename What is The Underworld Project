<h1 align="center">What is The Underworld Project?</h1>
<p>The Underworld Project is a story I’ve been toying with for years, important for my fantasy world, but not quite linear enough to get a section of its own. Instead I figured the best way to craft the story is to see what others can make of it in their heads.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p><strong>E</strong>veryone dies one day, and their souls move on. It's just how things work. We mourn the losses and move on, carrying the weight of their lives on our backs until it catches us too. The soul cycle is an interesting one, one many scholars have peered into to the best of their abilities. Our souls - to put it simply - don't belong to us. when we die, they're tossed back into the cycle of reincarnation to be brought back into a new body. While not every living being has one, sapient beings who reproduce sexually require one to exist as the natural magic of the world is unable to inhabit them. As we live our day to day lives, we imprint on this soul, molding it into something new and unique. Think of it not as a string of unchangeable code, but a piece of clay passed down through generations. Unless cursed to the soul itself, it doesn't matter who you used to be. It's beautiful in a sense... unless you happen to be the kind of person who doesn't care about harming others. No one is inherently pure, we all are the villains in another's story, however every bad deed weighs on your soul, making it harder and harder for one to be subsumed back into the cycle of reincarnation that claims us all. The wicked never truly move on. Should your sins become too great, your name living in everyone’s heads as the person they mustn't become, you won’t be able to leave the plain of life, stuck in suspension between life and death. In order to purge the sins that cursed you to remain trapped, you must go through suffering equal to what you made others go through.</p>

<p>Hell.</p>

<p>Every continent has its own version of hell, a place where entities keep the cycle balanced and deliver the purified souls to the angels so they might just get the chance to live a better life. Demons, constructs, lost souls, and the like are all things you will witness if you find yourself here. Trapped in Limbo, sorted into the ring of which you most fit, and tormented until your soul is finally freed by victims of your own making. Your only means of escape being to repent to those you've wronged. You'll be spared the worst fate, either given a second chance to pay your dues or a mercifully quick death. If you attempt to fight back, give in to your worst traits, dig your feet in the sand and continue to insist you don't know what you did to deserve such a fate, consequences will increase. And if you were especially bad, you will meet one of the dukes of Hell face to face. It is nearly impossible to fight back against a duke, much less kill them. They will hand you your punishment on a silver platter, regardless of if they have to force it into your hands. The denizens of hell aren't bound by our morality; that's what makes them so terrifying, and so effective at purifying souls.</p>
