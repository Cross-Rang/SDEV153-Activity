<h2>Who are you?</h2>

<p>My pseudonym for this project is Anthony. I specify this because this is both something I want to eventually share online and something I am turning in for college. As of writing this, I am a nineteen year old transgender male.</p>

<h2>What are your inspirations for this project?</h2>

<p>There's a lot I could say that has inspired this project as it's technically been around since 2017. A lot of elements only inspired the characters of the story, so to keep this concise I'll only include broad elements that impacted many different aspects of the story and not just a few characters.</p>
<ul>
<li>The biggest inspiration that cannot be ignored is Dante's Inferno. I found a lot of stories tend to focus on the Seven Deadly Sins which is interesting but I am a person who makes way too many characters for the simplest of things, so I ended up going with the bigger number. And then multiplied it by three for good measure.</li>
<li>The Splatterpunk genre, a genre of horror characterized by over the top gore, nausea-inducing scenes, and miscellaneous controversial themes (a popular example being Hellraiser). I was inspired by the way they vividly describe scenes so a lot of my horror moments and ideas for punishments have similar over the top depictions of gore and dehumanization. I don't interact with a lot of splatterpunk media myself (mostly because the controversial themes can be anything from the fact kinks exist to just straight up pedophilia without any warning) however Jules Dapper on Youtube has a series where she gives honest reviews of books in this genre which helps me better gauge if it's something I'm comfortable reading or not.</li>
<li>Tumblr Puritanism in a sense. As a Tumblr user I have found that its lack of an algorithm has made it easy for users to become locked in an echo chamber, which more often than not leads to extreme black and white thinking, barely disguised prejudice, and everyone who regularly engages in interacting with people offline sometimes becoming fed up with them after the third post in a row of grade-school slap fighting. This inspired the absolute morality Jenga of every character here because I'm sick and tired of being advertised "morally grey" characters whose worst sin is kinda being a jerk sometimes. Everyone in this story engages in the torture and murder of the people sentenced to Hell in order to keep 85% of sapient species alive and enjoys it, whether or not they're a nice person to be around or had a tragic past to explain how they act is irrelevant. </li>
<li>Heroes of Might and Magic V, specifically the Necromancer faction. Some areas are more obvious than others, but I love the aesthetic of this dark, dreary place decorated in cathedrals and decayed woods, dark forbidden magic hiding in every crevice, where anyone living is looked down on or lured into death traps with everyone having a different view of how to spend their unlife. </li>
</ul>
